                            <p>The fab documentation is fully based on git. I also as some experience with git version control system by sharing most of my open source project on GitHub. (<a href="http://www.github.com/salmanfarisvp">github.com/salmanfarisvp</a>)</p>
                            
                            <h3>Installing Ubuntu</h3>
                            <img src="images/week2/ubuntu16.04.jpg" height="250">
                            <p>My instructor told me to better to use any Linux distro, as of now I have experience in Raspbian(Raspberry + Debian) it's a Single board computer. anyway, i would like to learn new things so I installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS version.</p>
                            <p>ubuntu is Debian based distro and managed by canonical limited, there is so many Linux based distro available like yocto, arch, Debian, mint...etc. I chose Ubuntu LTS because it has a huge community base, LTS means it gives Long Term Support like security patches.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/drive.png" height="75">
                            <p>my laptop has 500 GB hard-disk and 2 partitions, one is <b>C</b> that's have Windows os and another one <b>D</b> that's for storing my personal files.</p>
                            <p>i decided to install ubuntu by creating a new partition for Local Disk(D):that's for Windows OS and another for my personal file partition.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/shrink001.png" height="200">
                            <p>with the help of windows Disk management tool, we can simply shrink a volume of any drive.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/shrink002.png" height="250">
                            <p>and given how much amount we need to shrink from this drive . in ubuntu we need only 25 GB, I'll just give 100GB. because in the academy time I will be using the ubuntu so we need more space store our files.</p>
                            <p>after that, i downloaded the ubuntu 16.04 because that's the only version now have LTS (website: -https://www.ubuntu.com/)</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/ubuntusite.png" height="300">
                            <p>i used Ethcher tool to burn the iso to USB. it's great simple open source tool by resin.io</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/imageburn.png" height="300">
                            <p>After the burning the image, I turn-off the laptop and entered in boot menu (sorry, I can't take screenshot from there.)and choose boot from usb,and it's starting to install ubuntu after I selected appropriate drive (the free space that we are created ).</p>
                            
                            <blockquote>After the installation I force to restart my system, but after that system not booting the ubuntu os, automatically entering windows 10 . so I searched that, so found that I need to switch the ubuntu boot manager to get an option ubuntu or windows when system on, so I just restart computer and get back to the boot manager and changed the boot manager windows to ubuntu.</blockquote>
                            
                            <h3>Setup Git</h3>
                            <img src="images/week2/git.png">
                            <p>Git is verison control system for traking changes in computer file and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.</p>
                            <p>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux Kernal.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/gitwork.png">
                            <p>This is a great example that shows how git works.</p>
                            <p>After the installation of Ubuntu I installed git by typing <Code>sudo apt-get install git</Code> on my linux terminal.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/gitinstall.png">
                            <p>You can also check that you already installed git or not by typig <code>git help</code> on your terminal.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/githelp.png" height="450">
                            <p>now we can confirm that we have installed git client successful on our Ubuntu machine.</p>
                            
                            
                            <h3>Setup Gitlab and SSH</h3>
                            <p>Gitlab is web-based Git Repository manager with wiki and issue tracking features. </p>
                            <p>In order to upload(push) our files to Gitlab Repository we need to setup our computer by Genarating SSH key. </p>
                            <p>SSH is provide a Private/Public key management System</p>
                            <p>First Genarate SSH key by typing <code>SSH-keygen,</code> on Terminal.</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/ssh01.png">
                            <p>so we genarated our ssh key, next copy the c key from the file that we saved .</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/ssh02.png">
                            <p>now sync with gitlab by pasting the ssh key to the gitlab</p>
                            <p>open gitlab account and open settings</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/ssh03.png" height="300">   
                            <p>Open SSH Panel</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/ssh04.png">
                            <p>Paste your key here</p>
                            <img src="images/week2/ssh05.png" height="300">
                            <p>Now Git and Gitlab was configured .</p>
                        
                            <h3>Build a Website</h3>

                            <p>first we need clone the old repo.</p>
                            <p>after the web page development, we need add the new items by typing <code>git add --all</code></p>
                            <p>after the add we need commit by typing <code>git commit -m "message here"</code></p>
                            <p>after the commit , we need upload to Gitlab by typing <code>git push</code></p>
