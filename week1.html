                            <h1>Smart Waste Bin</h1>
                            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                            <p>The waste collection process is a critical aspect for the service providers. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins is a complex, cumbersome process and utilizes more human effort, time and cost which is not compatible with the present day technologies. Irregular management of waste typically domestic waste, industrial waste and environmental waste is a root cause for many of the human problems such as pollution, diseases and has adverse effects on the hygiene of living beings. In order to overcome all these problems, we are proposing the idea of smart waste management system which helps in auto-management of waste without human interaction in order to maintain a clean environment.</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week1/001.jpg" width="60%"></center>
                            <p>Currently, most municipal waste collection operations focus on emptying containers according to predefined schedules at a set frequency. This system is inherently inefficient, with half-full bins being emptied, poor use of city assets, and unnecessary fuel consumption. Smart solutions—for tracking waste levels, route optimization, and operational analytics—offer municipalities and waste service managers the ability to optimize waste management services, reduce operational costs, and better address the environmental issues associated with inefficient waste collection.<br>Most waste companies still operate using a traditional collection process, whereby bins are lifted on fixed days and static routes. This is highly inefficient, as trucks drive a considerable distance to collect bins that aren’t full, while ignoring others that are overfilled.<br> As a result, logistics costs are too high, customer service is poor and carbon emissions are through the roof. <br> Root cause is the lack of visibility on bin ‘<b>demand</b>’. Wouldn’t it be great if bins could do the talking? This is now possible by <b>Internet of Things</b>.</p>

                            <h3>The Solution</h3>
                            <p>Sensor Based Waste Collection Bins is used to identify status of waste bins if it is empty or filled so as to customize the waste collection schedule accordingly and also save the cost. Real time waste mangement system by using smart bins to check the fill level of smartbins whether the dustbins are full or not, through this system the information of all smart bins can be accessed from anywhere and anytime by the concern person. It will inform the status of each and every dustbin in real time so that concerned authority can send the garbage collection vehicle only when the dustbin is full. By implementing this system resource optimization, cost reduction, effective usage of smart bins can be done.</p>

                            <p>The network of sensors enabled smart bins connected through the cellular network generates a large amount of data, which is further analyzed and visualized at real time to gain insights about the status of waste around the city.</p>

                            <h3>Benefits of using Smart Bins</h3>
                            <ul>
                            <li>It will stop overflowing of wastebins along roadsides and localities as smartbins are managed at real time.</li>
                            <li>The filling and cleaning time of smart bin will also be reduced thus making empty and clean dustbins available to common people.</li>
                            <li>By using the route algorithm it will smartly find the shortest route thus it will reduce the number of vehicles used for garbage collection.</li>
                            <li>Send optimized routes directly to drivers</li>
                            <li>It will reduce fuel Consumption.</li>
                            <li>Improved customer service by lifting bins that need a collection</li>
                            
                            
                            </ul>
