                            <center><img src="images/week3/raster.jpg" height="150"><img src="images/week3/vector.jpg" height="150"> </center><br>
                            <p>I just got the idea between raster and vector images by just looking at this picture, this explains everything<br>
                            <b>Raster image </b> is made up of individual pixels. Each pixel contains only one colour and is arranged in a certain fashion to make up the image. This is how normal pictures are displayed. The problem with raster image is that the maximum resolution is limited by the number of pixels.<br>
                            That means, when you try and scale the image into a larger size, the quality drops and the edges of lines become fuzzy (staircase effect). This is the major limitation of using raster images.<br><br>
                            <b>vector image</b>  is composed of paths, which are represented by mathematical functions. These mathematical function represents the actual borders and the different elements in the image. Hence the maximum resolution of the image is not limited by the number of pixels. These mathematical functions can scale easily giving lossless ability to zoom to any extent on the image.</p>

                            <p>You can erase pixels in a raster image using the eraser tool but, that is not possible in a vector image. In a vector image you can only trim the path according to some constrains.(I got this great explanation from the internet)</p>

                            <h3>Raster</h3>
                            <h4><u>GIMP</u></h4>
                            <p>GIMP is Free and Open Source Raster Graphic editor used for image retouching and editing ,i feel like it's open source verison of photoshop.I just Designed a logo for Water level meter (it's a old project idea). </p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimpdetails.png"  height="500"></center><br>
                            <p>There is acutally <b>Three</b> main windows, <b>Toolbox panel</b> , <b>GIMP Window</b> and <b>Layers/Burshes Panel</b>, in default three panels are seprated , but we can manually dock three panels togther, i choosed docked window.i started to design a logo,<br> so first i started to create <b>canvas</b> with size <b>1020x1024 px</b> in <code>File --> New </code></p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp001.PNG" height="400">  <img src="images/week3/gimp002.PNG" height="400"></center><br>
                            <p>Here i created a canvas with size 1024 x 1024 , now we can start to draw , it's better to get <b>guide lines</b> when we draw or write something , so next am going to add a <b>vertical</b>and <b>horizontal</b> guide line. we can add new guide in <code>Image => Guides => New Guide</code></p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp003.PNG" height="500"> </center><br>
                            <p>In the following winow we can select where we need to guide , <b>Horizontal</b> or <b>vertical</b>.</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp004.PNG" height="250"></center><br>
                            <p>Here First i selected horizontal guide line in center position by selection <b>50%</b> in position.after setting both horizontal and vertical we can see the window like this.we can actually set the guide line anywhere in the canvas , here we only need only two in the middle.</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp005.PNG" height="500"></center><br>
                            <p>Now can see a light blue lines added as guide lines in the center of the canvas , Now we can start to drawing .I need to design a logo, my plan to design a rounded logo , so first i started design a circle , it can be easliy align in center with the guide lines.</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp006.PNG" height="300"> <img src="images/week3/gimp007.PNG" height="300"></center><br>
                            <p>Here i utilized the guide lines to draw a perfect circle , and i also used <b>gradient</b> to color the circle .gradient is a color ramp or color progression, here i used green and hash color to make the logo <b>color progression</b>. I want to write the name on the center of the logo , i just created another circle the center and deleted the un-wanted portion from the drawings.</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp008.PNG" height="300"><img src="images/week3/gim009.PNG" height="300"></center><br>
                            <p>For deleting the Circle portion , first selected the inner circle and cuted part by right clicking and select cut part.next i added another circle inside the main circle and filled color in the circle gap between main circle and the smaller circle we just created now . next i added text "SENSE" the same light blue color .</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/gimp009.PNG" height="400"> <img src="images/week3/gimp0010.PNG" height="400"></center><br>
                            <p>Now we got our completed logo, so next i exported image as <b>JPG</b>.here you can Download the logo <b><a href="resource/week3.zip">GIMP Design File </a></b>  </p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/senselogo.jpg" height="500"></center>
                            <p>i recorded my scree while designing the logo , we get better under standing when watch this about how to make a logo using <b>GIMP</b>.</p>

                            <p><b>Krita</b> is a free and open-source raster graphics editor designed primarily for digital painting animation purpose.I would like to do simple  animation so i think  this is best way.Now am going make a dancing animation . the animation is done by drawing pictures and it will play one by one we can feel that like a moving object , so here we are drawing imegs (yes multiple images )to make it move.Krita Download link :- <a herf="https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/">https://krita.org/en/download/krita-desktop/</a></p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/krita.png" height="580"></center><br>
                            <p>I downloaded and installed the krita app on my windows machine , but due to some problems i ued fab linux machine for this , first i created new file by <code>File => New </code> . and i selected Custom document and at clicked <b>Create</b>.</p>
                            <center><img src="images/week3/krita001.PNG"></center><br>
                            <p>First i draw a face with using <b>3.40 px</b> brush , just smiple face and after that i utlized Timeline section to create a new frame ,after getting new frame i draw other parts like hands up and down images. </p>
