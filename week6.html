                           <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>This week Professor Neil gave us a over-all Introduction about 3D printing and 3D Scanning also it's various methods  .I was very exited in 3D printing.so in this week we need to print and non-subtractive model and 3D scan an object. </p>
                            <h3>3D Printing </h3>
                            <p>3D Printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates a physical object from a digital design. There are different 3D printing technologies and materials you can print with, but all are based on the same principle: a digital model is turned into a solid three-dimensional physical object by adding material layer by layer. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.(Source :- <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com">https://www.3dhubs.com</a>)</p>

                            <p>There is different way to print a 3D object. </p>
                            <ul>
                            <li><b>Stereolithography(SLA)</b></li>
                                <p> This process that converts liquid plastic into solid objects.</p>
                                <img src="images/week6/002.png">
                                <p>These 3D printing technologies are also available in desktop 3D printers. Materials are limited to resins, but new varieties have appeared recently providing strength or flexibility to the final objects.SLA and DLP 3D printers produce highly accurate parts with smooth surface finishes and are commonly used for highly detailed sculptures, jewelry molds, and prototypes. Because of their relatively small size, they are not recommended for printing large objects.(Source :- <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com">https://www.3dhubs.com</a>)</p> 
                            
                            <li><b>Fused-deposition molding (FDM)</b></li>
                                <p>The FDM printing process starts with a string of solid material called the filament. This line of filament is guided from a reel attached to the 3D printer to a heated nozzle inside of the 3D printer that melts the material. Once in a melted state, the material can be extruded on a specific and predetermined path created by the software on the computer. As the material is extruded as a layer of the object on this path, it instantly cools down and solidifies – providing the foundation for the next layer of material until the entire object is manufactured. </p>

                                <p>As the cheapest 3D printing technology on the market, FDM also offers a wide variety of plastic-based materials in a rainbow of colors including ABS, PLA, nylon and even more exotic material blends including carbon, bronze or wood.(Source :- <a href="https://www.3dhubs.com">https://www.3dhubs.com</a>)</p>

                                <p>Material Jetting (Stratasys PolyJet and 3D Systems MultiJet Modeling) technologies are similar to inkjet printing, but instead of jetting drops of ink onto paper, these 3D printers jet layers of liquid photopolymer onto a build tray and cure them instantly using UV light.</p>

                                <p>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) uses a laser to melt and solidify layers of powdered material into finished objects.</p>

                            <p>The material used will affect the mechanical properties and accuracy of the printed part, but also its price. The most common FDM materials are summarized in the table below.

This combined with a soluable support material and build volume of 25.4 x 25.4 x 30.5 cm means that the Dimension 1200es reliably provides good qulaity prints at a locked layer thckness of 254 microns.</p>

                        <p>and i copy the sliced G-code file to SD card , The Estimated time is 14 hour and 00 min that's included other print , but it's a bad idea.</p>
                        <p>It's started smootly and some how filament jammed and printing was stucked. </p>

                        <p>3D Scanning is a process to convert Real 3D object to computer File.it's opposit process of 3D Design .Today there somany  3D Scanner's avilable, Depthsensor like Micorsoft Kinect and Intel Real-Sense is a good Example.</p>
                        <p>In this week am using two method to scan a 3D object , using Modela and Microsoft Xbox Kinect. </p>
                        <p><b>Modela</b></p>

                        <p>In the Electronics Production we used modela a lot for milling our PCB , the same modela we are using for Scan 3D object. but in here we changed the milling head to Scanning head.</p>
                        <p>here i,am scanning small gear.</p>

                        <p>After that i tested the Area by using the <b>begin Test Area</b> option after that i started scanning.</p>

Based around a webcam-style add-on peripheral, it enables users to control and interact with their console/computer without the need for a game controller, through a natural user interface using gestures and spoken commands.</p>
