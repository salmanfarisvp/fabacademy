                            <h3>Introduction</h3>
                            <p>This weeek we need to Design and build a mold also need to cast it .it's a process of manufacturing by shaping liquid or pliable raw material using a rigid frame called a mold or matrix. This itself may have been made using a pattern or model of the final object. <br>
                            <b>Casting</b> is a manufacturing process in which a liquid material is usually poured into a mold, which contains a hollow cavity of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. The solidified part is also known as a casting, which is ejected or broken out of the mold to complete the process. Casting materials are usually metals or various cold setting materials that cure after mixing two or more components together; examples are <b>epoxy, concrete, plaster</b>  and <b>clay.</b> Casting is most often used for making complex shapes that would be otherwise difficult or uneconomical to make by other methods</p>
                            
                            <h3>Design a 3D Mold</h3>
                            <p>My Goal is make <b>FabLab Pendent</b> so, started Design with <b>Rhino</b> .</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/001.png" height="500">
                            <p>I designed a <b>3D</b> of Mold and my plan to make negative mold using the Postive Mold. so Finally i will get Negative Mold and it can be used for casting Postive Molds. </p>
                           <iframe width="640" height="480" src="https://sketchfab.com/models/77ed543e5c8a45a9b7fac97ee764be8d/embed?autospin=0.2&amp;autostart=1" frameborder="0" allowvr allowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" onmousewheel=""></iframe><br><br>
                                
                            <p>i Exported Design as <b>.stl</b> format and i used <b>Fab Module </b> with <b>Modela MDX</b> for milling. I choosed <b>Fab Module </b> because it's very easy to use and simple UI. i tried with new fab tool but it's little bit difficult so i choosed old fab module.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/004.jpg" height="500"><br>
                            <p> I choosed <b>1/8 Ball Nose End mill</b> with <b>4 Flute</b></p>
                            <img src="images/week10/005.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>I used <b>5x20</b> Wax brick for milling the mold.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/006.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>secured Wax brick in Modela Sacrificial layer with using a 3M double tap insulation.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/007.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>with the help of fab module i calibrated <b>X,Y</b> and <b>Z</b> axis.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/002.png" height="500">
                            <p>There is two part in Milling a <b>WAX</b> ,First <b>Rough Cut </b> then <b>Finish Cut</b>, and we need to change parameter for different settings in fab module.<br>First i used Rough cut with 1/8 FlatEnd Bit.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/008.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>we got somany waste wax while milling the mold , instructor told me to collect all with a vacum cleaner so later we can melt it to make new wax brick. </p>
                            <img src="images/week10/003.png" height="500">
                            <p>after the <b>rough cut</b> it's ready to <b>Finish cut</b>.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/009.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>This is our complete Postive Mold, now we need to make a Negative Mold using this, unfortunately mold side wall is too thin so it's broken in finish cut.</p>
                                
                            <h3>Neagative Mold</h3>
                            <p>So now we got the Postive Mold , next we need to make Neagtive Mold using the Positive Mold.</p>
                            <img src="images/week10/0010.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>i just filled some water to know the volume. </p>

                            <p>So now we know the Volume of the mold.next we need to make mold, i choosed <b>SMOOTH-ON Liquid Rubber.</b></p>

                            <p>SORTA-Clear™ Series rubbers are premium water white translucent silicone rubbers (platinum catalyst) which cure at room temperature with negligible shrinkage. Sorta Clear 37 has Shore 37A hardness and features high tensile and tear strength. This product also offers the convenience of a 1A:1B by volume mix ratio.it's silicones are ideal for making prototype, jewelry or other molds of any configuration where model visibility is important (i.e. extracting a model from the mold via cutting). Materials such as urethane, epoxy or polyester resins can then be cast into SORTA-Clear™ silicone without application of a release agent. Other materials such as wax and low melt metal alloys can also be cast into SORTA-Clear™. SORTA-Clear™ can be pigmented with SILC Pig™ silicone pigments.<br>SORTA Clear™ 37 silicone rubber is FOOD SAFE and can be used for culinary applications including casting chocolate and other confections.

                            <img src="images/week10/0019.jpg" height="500">
                            <p>in here we are using Smooth-Cast® 300 Series of liquid plastics are ultra-low viscosity casting resins that yield castings that are bright white and virtually bubble free. Vacuum degassing is not necessary. They offer the convenience of a 1A:1B by volume or 100A:90B by weight mix ratio. The differences between them are pot life and demold time.

                            <p>next we need to take equal amounts of Parts A and B into mixing container (100A:90B by weight) and mix thoroughly. Stir deliberately making sure that you scrape the sides and bottom of the mixing container several times.</p>

                            <p>No ingredients are hazardous according to Regulation 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard 29 CFR 1910.1200 criteria.</p>
                            
                            <li><b>First Aid Measures</b></li><br>
                            <p><b>Inhalation:</b> Remove source(s) of contamination and move victim to fresh air. If breathing has stopped, give artificial respiration, then oxygen if needed. Contact physician immediately.<br> <b>Eye Contact:</b> Flush eyes with plenty of water. If irritation persists, seek medical attention.<br> <b>Skin Contact:</b> In case of skin contact, wash thoroughly with soap and water.<br> <b>Ingestion:</b> Do not induce vomiting unless instructed by a physician. Never give anything by mouth to an unconscious person</p>
                                
                            <li><b>Fire-Fighting Measures</b></li>
                            <p> Use water spray to cool fire-exposed surfaces and to protect personnel. Shut off “fuel” to fire. If a leak or spill has not ignited, use water spray to disperse the vapors. Either allow fire to burn under controlled conditions or extinguish with foam or dry chemical. Try to cover liquid spills with foam. Because fire may produce toxic thermal decomposition products, wear a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) with a full face piece operated in pressure demand or positive-pressure mode.</p>

                            <p>Keep container(s) tightly closed and properly labeled. Store in cool, dry, well ventilated place away from heat, direct sunlight, strong oxidizers and any incompatibles. Store in approved containers and protect against physical damage. Keep containers securely sealed when not in use. Indoor storage should meet OSHA standards and appropriate fire codes. Containers that have been opened must be carefully resealed to prevent leakage. Empty containers retain residue and may be dangerous. Avoid water contamination.</p>
                                
                            <li><b>Exposure Controls / Personal Protection</b></li><br>
                            <p><b>Hand Protection:</b> Wear any liquid-tight gloves such as butyl rubber, neoprene or PVC.<br>
                            <b>Eye Protection:</b> Safety glasses with side shields per OSHA eye- and face-protection regulations 29 CFR 1910.133 and European Standard EN166. Contact lenses are not eye protective devices. Appropriate eye protection must be worn instead of, or in conjunction with contact lenses.<br> <b>Other Protective Clothing/Equipment:</b> Additional protective clothing or equipment is not normally required. Provide eye bath and safety shower.<br> <b>Comments:</b> Never eat, drink, or smoke in work areas. Practice good personal hygiene after using this material, especially before eating, drinking, smoking, using the toilet, or applying cosmetics.

                            <p>The Smooth-Cast™ 300 Series of liquid plastics are ultra-low viscosity casting resins that yield castings that are bright white and virtually bubble free. Vacuum degassing is not necessary. They offer the convenience of a 1A:1B by volume or 100A:90B by weight mix ratio. The differences between them are pot life and demold time </p>

                            <p>Epoxy Resins are thermosetting resins, which cure by internally generated heat. Epoxy systemsconsist of two parts, resin and hardener. When mixed together, the resin and hardener activate,causing a chemical reaction, which cures (hardens) the material.We are offering High Glossy , Transparent,  low viscosity and UV stable liquid epoxy resin for casting, coatings, and adhesive applications.
